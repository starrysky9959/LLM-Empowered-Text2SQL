The query is using a JOIN clause to combine data from two tables: basketball_match and university. It is leveraging the School_ID as a foreign key in the basketball_match table which is the primary key in the university table. The direction of this JOIN is as follows - teams data from the basketball_match table is joined with university data.
The query is using the SELECT statement to fetch the team name 't2.team_name' and the ACC during the regular season 't2.ACC_Regular_Season' for this school.\nNow, the JOIN has been performed on the condition where School_IDs in both the tables are equal. This helps in getting the corresponding team name and ACC data for each school.\n\nThe query is then ordering the result by the 'founded' date of the schools in ascending order i.e., the oldest school first.\n\nFinally, the query is using the LIMIT clause to restrict the result to only one - the school with the earliest 'founded' date. So, it will return the name of the team and the ACC during the regular season for this school founding the earliest.\n
